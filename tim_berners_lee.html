          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p> In today’s society we are all connected. There has never been an easier time in human history for people to be able to search and find such a wide range of documents that the world wide web has to offer. This was made possible by a man called Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist that invented the world wide web in 1989, little did he know that this invention would change the way humans live and how our society functions as a whole. This is why I have asked the question “how has Tim Berners-Lee changed the way we live today”. Some of the positive and negative topics that we will be outlining are as fallows; physical/mental health, social skills, security, communication, access to information, business applications and convenience. The main focus of this essay will be how these properties effect the way we live in our everyday lives. </p>


          <p> The world wide web is arguably one of the most ground breaking inventions of the 20th century and this is very evident due to how it took off. There are more than 7,500.000.000 currently occupying the world, but over half of these individuals have access and use the internet and the number of internet users are increasing every day. This is a baffling margin when compared to other products simply because very few of these products are this popular and as globally accessible. Due to the vast number of users that interact with the web there is now a global network that links us all together and this is one of the main reasons that have made the web so innovative. One of the main reasons that the web is so popular and accessible is due to it being free to use by any induvial who pays to have an internet connection, this makes the web non-discriminative and this principle is known as net neutrality. Although the web is such an amazing invention with so much potential there are two sides of the effects it has, there are clear positives and negatives that the web is responsible for.

          </p>

          <h2>Health</h2>

          <p> It is extremely clear today that we are the most well-versed generation when it comes to our mental/physical health, this is due to our education system as well as the all this information being accessible online or elsewhere. One of the negative aspects that I would like to outline is how the web has had an effect on some individuals physical/mental health. In order to use the we you must have a device that can access it and this is where the physical problems come in to play, by using the web excessively can cause you to put on wait, damage your eye sight as well as Musculoskeletal problems. One of the worst problems someone can deal with is sleep deprivation, this is caused by the bright light from any device that you use to access the web. The bright light that comes from these devices block melatonin secretion which is the hormone that regulates our sleep. This is not the only down sides to using the web excessively. Mental health is arguably much more important, and this is also affected by the over use of the web. It can cause an increase in an individual’s anxiety, you have a higher risk of depression and it causes a negative impact on your social skills. </p>



          <h2>Security</h2>

          <p> While we are all online, we always have to be vigilant towards the risks that there are on the web. When we are online, we are all in danger from a number of security risks that put our own personal details in harm’s way. Not only individuals are at risk, business and anything on the web will always be at risk simply due to the fact that there will always be individuals that have malicious intent. Some of the risks that we are exposed to are as fallows; viruses, trojan horses, fraud and adware/spyware. The most common risk to individuals are viruses, approximately 33% of household computers are affected with a type of malware in which more than half of these are viruses. These viruses and malware steal data from the device that is infected such as passwords or even go as far as to delete data from your hard drive.</p>

          <h2>Knoledge</h2>

          <p> One of the worldwide web’s greatest attributes is how much information it holds which we can all access. If someone asks a question that no one knows, the iconic reply is “google it”. Search engines have made the web so easy to use and this has opened up an endless stream of knowledge and possibility. The web is always being monitored and on Monday, 25th November 2019 the indexed web contained at least 6.19 billion pages, this is always growing and there is no knowing the limit this could reach. All of these pages are at our disposal, this is a huge amount of information that we can access if and when we need to. This has made a huge impact on our everyday lives, nearly anything we want to know can be found on the internet, this makes it extremely easy to self-educate and become more enlightened on a wide range of subjects. This is one of the aspects of the internet that is so beneficial</p>
